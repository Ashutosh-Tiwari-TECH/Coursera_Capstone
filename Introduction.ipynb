    "Introduction : Accident Risk analysis for the Seattle city\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The car accidents are major problem now a day while we all go out of our homes for work and other stuff. And lots of people do not return back to the home by loosen there life and many end up with serious injuries for lifetime. Road accidents are an important issue of our modern societies, responsible for millions of deaths and injuries every year in the world. In Quebec only, in 2018, road accidents are responsible for 359 deaths and 33 thousands of injuries. In this paper, we show how one can leverage open datasets of a city like Seattle, Canada, to create high-resolution accident prediction models, using big data analytics. Compared to other studies in road accident prediction, we have a much higher prediction resolution, i.e., our models predict the occurrence of an accident within an hour, on road segments defined by intersections. Such models could be used in the context of road accident prevention, but also to identify key factors that can lead to a road accident, and consequently, help elaborate new policies.\n",
    "    We have to come up with a solution which can provide alert to the drivers by analysing the different conditions and provide some guidance on the basis of alert like what steps can be taken to avoid any mishappening. \n",
    "    The main purpose of this project is to analyse the 'Severity' by considering different attributes and come up with co-relation in independent variable to the dependent variable.\n"
